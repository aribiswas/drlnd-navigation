# drlnd-navigation

## Getting Started

**Install Prerequisites:**

To run this project, you must have Python 3.6, Pytorch and Unity ML-Agents toolkit installed. Follow the instructions in Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to install the required dependencies.

You must also use one of the following Unity environments for this project. Download the environment specific to your platform and place it in the same folder as this project.

* [Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
* [Mac OSX](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
* [Windows (32-bit)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
* [Windows (64-bit)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

**Running the code**

You can run the code from any Python IDE or a terminal. 

To run the code in a Jupyter notebook, open the ***Navigation.ipynb*** file. This notebook goes through staring the Unity environment, creating the agent and training.

To run from a terminal, run ***nav_train.py*** to train the agent, or ***nav_sim.py*** to watch a trained agent.
